The formula for d is: $$d = Z*\sqrt(N)$$
 
The formula for Z is: $$Z = \frac{M - \mu}{\sigma_M}$$
 
The code to use MOTE in R is: 
 
```{r help, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
source("output_functions.R")
library(knitr)
library(MOTE)
saved = help_console(d.z.z, "html", before = "", after = "")
```
 
`r paste(saved[-c(1:8)], collapse = " ")`
